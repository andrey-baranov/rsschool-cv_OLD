# Code example: #
  **Codewars** *Consider an array/list of sheep where some sheep may be missing from their place. We need a function that counts the number of sheep present in the array (true means present).*  
  ```
  function countSheeps(arrayOfSheep) {
  // TODO May the force be with you
  var num = 0;
  
  for(var i = 0; i < arrayOfSheep.length; i++)
    if(arrayOfSheep[i] == true)
